# How to build a responsive card component with @container CSS style
The main overall objective of this design is to **show how we can build a
responsive design** that works perfectly on all devices using @container in CSS

## How it works ## 
**The simple way of creating it is to create a div container
that will hold the content you wish to make responsive, and follow it
With the @containers type attribute in CSS, that's all.**
---
**It serves the same purpose as @media query, the only difference is that you 
worked based on the parent width of the content instead of targeting the
viewport of the screen size in a case of media query**
---

**The key advantages are that it work like component or bundle that is easily 
reusable on any project, need of typing a bunch of css style in every component of 
your UI design.**
